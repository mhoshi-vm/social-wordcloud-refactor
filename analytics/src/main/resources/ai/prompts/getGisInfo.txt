Estimate the location of the message and generate a coordinate.
Do not give me a summary.
Always prefer use the text column to determine the location.
If not possible use alternate information such as origin column.
Generate the message_id, the timestamp from createDateTime column(without timezone), coordinate in GIS POINT() format, srid, and also a brief summary of why you believe it is that location.
The next lines is the message in Json.
